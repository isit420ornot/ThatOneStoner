          <p>I am so excited right now... because for the first time... in a long time... I'm not feeling like I'm just killing time until I figure out what to do with the skills that I've aquired over the years...

            <br><br>

            All that I've ever known is that I don't want to die while living a 9 to 5 existence... especially now that I'm older with no social circle to occupy my off hours life with... working just to live always seemed rather pointless to me...
            but
            I've also lived a pretty self-destructive life... often just for the thrill...

            <br><br>

            I recently returned home after staying way too late to the party... and have been spinning my wheels ever since... this is why I took up online education as a hobby... in the hopes that I would find a monetizable skill... I've had some
            success with a few of my ventures... but only enough to barely cover my bills... it's a good thing that I don't take all that much to live...

            <br><br>

            My hopes are high for this project... because... unlike the projects of the past... I'm going to try to keep ThatOneStoner.com accessable to a broader audience by commiting to the pothead taking on affordable education as this website's
            theme... I feel like I can commit this time because... I have IsIt420OrNot.com as a release for any surreal/visual digital art that may preoccupy my mind...

            <br><br>

            I also like the idea of having this site for my secondary blog... my primary blog... TheWickerBreaker.com... is something I started years ago to practive writing outside of the screenplay format... it's a pretty fun site... but it's grown
            to be very convoluted over the years... making it hard to navigate due to the template that I used for the main design...


      <br><br>

            For this site... I will be going template free to learn what it will take to go back and fix any what you see is what you get design flaws of my other online projects... I can't wait to share my progress as I learn how to make a template
            free site as these coding languages continue to be second nature in my head... which is why I'm so excited to be where I currently am... at least considering the current state of the world...

        <h3 class="assignment_mini_title">The Task At Hand...</h3>



        <br>
        <p>
          For this assignment... I'm supposed to create a landing page with a sign up form... still using nothing but the HTML and CSS that's been covered throughout the class... which is why there will be no floating navbar or other decorative
          features that I'll be learning in the upcoming Bootstrap portion of the course...

          <br><br>

          I'm also supposed to add a sign up form that sends the user to a thank you page as soon as they submit an email address and message... only we've yet to learn how to make this messaging feature fully functional... so I'm going to stray a
          little from the course's content once again... and instead of creating a form that only technically works... I will create a newsletter subscription form through MailChimp... as well as a donation button for PayPal...

          <br><br>

          Feel free to do with these links as you please... since I don't really plan to pesture people with crowdfunding... and I still need to take a course on newsletter strategies before I utilize one as a marketing tool... but I may drop a note
          or two while I continue to complete assignments...

          <br><br>

          If all goes well... my first benchmark goal is to bring in $500 a month soon after completing this Bootcamp... and update my other websites to create a cohesive network of nonsense...

          <br><br>

          Thanks in advance for reading this far... and any efforts you make to play along... With all of that said... I give you the task at hand!!!
