      <h1 class="page_title">CSS Level Two</h1>

      <div class="css_two_content">

        <p id="pI">I've been up for 30 hours straight… working on these CSS projects... it’s not that I feel stuck on an issue… like a tongue to a mouth sore sort of thing… I’m not rushing to meet an assignment deadline… since this course is 100%
          self-paced… This is just how my OCD works… when I go in… I go all in… and I’m now fully into this bootcamp…</p>

        <p id="pII">I must be careful though... keeping in mind… that while I’m up all these hours… I typically get bedtime baked about twelve hours into my day… leaving me feeling extra sleep-deprived during the second half of my day… minus the
          intake of my midday Indica or any sedating aids… I can be up for days… and trigger a manic episode…</p>

        <p id="pIII">It sucks because there is a sweet spot… When I can keep myself in check… I can deprive myself of just the right amount of sleep to lower my inhibitions to feel confident… like I’m the real me in the real world… it’s a place that
          I rarely get to see… but it’s a place where I can drop my guard and let the talented portion of my brain take control…</p>

        <p id="pIV">A couple of years ago... I was diagnosed with OCD for the first time... I used to joke that I had OCD… but I always felt I was kidding… the same way people used to say they were retarded if they slipped up and did something by
          mistake… I always thought I was too big of a slob to have a disorder that’s so commonly associated with clean freaks…</p>

        <p id="pV">The more I started to learn about the disorder… and the internal thought processes of my kind… the more I see that there have always been clear signs… like not being able to leave the house unless it was on a quarter-hour… I used
          this quarter-hour ritual to make sure that I was either on time or fifteen minutes early to wherever I was heading out to…</p>

        <p id="pVI">I try to make my rituals more beneficial than fear-based… I noticed while I was writing that I wrote about my quarter-hour ritual in the past tense… even though I still use it to this day… I guess it might be that… since I no
          longer see it as a ritual but a trait that I decided to keep…</p>

        <p id="pVII">One ritual that I didn’t keep was organizing my CDs and DVDs by the color of their spines... with the background colors being the focus for the primary sort... and a secondary sort based on the colors of the text... I guess the
          fact that I did not freak out when others did not commit to my decor choice made me feel that I didn't have it all that bad...</p>

        <p id="pVIII">It wasn't until I almost had a complete mental breakdown after taking a day off from writing... that I finally realized how much my project… experiments… and challenges… are part of the fear-based aspect of OCD… my fear being
          that… if I were to take any time off… I may never write again… afraid that I might finally go all-in at giving up…</p>

        <p id="pIX">I now try to stay aware of this fear of giving up… but I do continue to chase that sleepless sweet spot… from time to time… And… with that bit of the history of my obsession with ordering things by color... it's time to introduce
          the task at hand... which is to digitally recreate the image below... an art installment from the 70's called Spectrum V... using nothing but HTML and CSS...</p>
