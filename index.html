  <h2 id="introTitle">Greetings Potheads and/or Learners!!!</h2>
  <p>Welcome to my latest project... my name is Bunker but I'm also known as The Wicker Breaker... and That One Stoner who runs IsIt420OrNot.com... this is my first venture back into blogging ever since I needed to take a break from TheWickerBreaker.com... and Is It 420 Or Not turned into more of an art project...
<br><br>I'm by no means giving up on either of the above mentioned projects... but I feel like I need to pick up a few more skills in order to bring my older work up to the quality that it deserves... since I always saw both projects as hobbies or my training ground... as if the finished product didn't still require a lot of work...
<br><br>You may be think I'm stoned... pointing out that I'm done looking at my efforts as training on this website that's all about me taking a class... well... you are correct... I am high... but... the irony was not missed... I will never stop learning... and this time... I'm going to try to learn how to put out professional content while still having fun... and stop using the excuse that I'm just in an early draft...
