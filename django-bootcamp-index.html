      <p>This is my second attempt to create a website based purly on projects
        from the affordable online courses that I now take as a hobby... Online education
        became an obsession several years back... soon after I lost sight of a decades
        long dream I once had... where I lived the life of a failed screenwriter...</p>
<br>
      <p>Attempt number one is the site... <a href="https://isit420ornot.com/">IsIt420OrNot.com</a>...
        which is still a work in progress... only the second that the bootcamp I was
        using to provide the site's structure taught me how to animate with CSS... <thead>
          site instantly became an art project...</p>
<br>
      <p>Though I'm fine with this turn of events... and love what the site's become...
        I found myself losing interest in the bootcamp because the courses are arranged
        logically... and not in the order that I feel I need to tell a story the way that
        I want to using web design...</p>
<br>
      <p>So... I found this new bootcamp that will provide the framework for this site...
        I'm sticking with the stoner motiff in my efforts to break the cliche of the
        unmotivated pothead... yes... I may have a goofy toker's sense of humor... but...
        I'd rather learn to build a video game than waste my high just playing one...</p>
<br>
      <p>This is a full stack bootcamp with an emphasis on Django... that said...
        the first several lessons focus on HTML and CSS... two design languages that I
        already feel confident with... but... I'm including completing and sharing the
        <a href="dbi-basics-html.html">assignments</a>... for those who are interested in seeing
        everything they could learn if they opted to
        <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/">
          play along</a>!!!</p>
<br>
      <p>I hope you enjoy my learning process...</p>


<br>
    <p>Sincerly...</p>
