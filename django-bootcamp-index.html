          <p>
            This is my second attempt to create a website based purely on projects from the affordable online courses that I now take as a hobby... Online education became an obsession several years back... soon after I lost sight of a decade's long
            dream I once had... where I lived the life of a failed screenwriter...
          </p>

          <br>

          <p>
            Attempt number one was/is the site... <a class="inlineLink" href="https://isit420ornot.com/">IsIt420OrNot.com</a>... which is still a work in progress... only the instant that the bootcamp I use to provide that site's structure introduced
            CSS animation... structure went right out the window as I found myself locked in yet another surreal project... that got too convoluted to be consumable... at least at this early stage...
          </p>

          <br>

          <p>
            I'm fine with this turn of events... and love what the site's become... I just found myself losing interest in the bootcamp with its courses arranged logically... and not in the order I need to develop a story the way that I want through
            web design... to be clear... I see this as a “me issue”... and not a fault of the course's content...
          </p>

          <br>

          <p>
            So… I found a new bootcamp to provide the framework for this site you're reading right now... I'm sticking with the stoner motif in my efforts to break the cliche of the unmotivated pothead... plus... I live in a state where it's legal...
            so I don't feel like it's an aspect of my life that I need to hide... since I didn't like marijuana until I started to legitimately use it as medicine... now I also enjoy the recreational high... which wasn't the case when I was a young
            punk and a daily drunk...
          </p>

          <br>
          <p>
            This new bootcamp is a full-stack course with an emphasis on Django... that said... the first several lessons focus on HTML and CSS... two design languages that I already feel pretty familiar with... but... I plan to complete every task
            without straying too far from the scope of each assignment as I go... for those interested in seeing what they could learn if they opt to <a class="inlineLink"
              href="https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/">play along</a>!!!
          </p>

          <br>
          <p>
            I hope you enjoy my learning process...
          </p>

          <br>

          <p>
            Sincerely...
          </p>
