        </h3>

        <div class="blog-post">
          <h2 class="blog-post-title">My Past Issues With BootStrap...</h2>
          <p class="blog-post-meta">July 31, 2020 by <a href="http://fubunker.com/">Bunker</a> <em>aka</em> <strong>That One Stoner</strong> </p>

          <p>This blog post shows how fighting structure can lead to a better understanding of the rules...</p>
          <hr>


          <em><strong>They</strong> say you must first know the rules before you can break them... <strong>they</strong> are also usually people who never take risks at all... <strong>they</strong> also never state the quote correctly...</em>
          <br><br>

          <h3>Who are they??? </h3>
          <p>How the hell should I know Connie??? I'm not here to talk about <strong>them</strong>... I'm here to talk about why I've been anti-Bootstrap ever since I took my first web dev course... a couple of years back... Keep in mind
            that... I've always seen all my efforts as a contected creative venture... with no dreams to build some ground breaking start-up... in an effort to take over the world...
            <br><br>
            I used to work with a guy who did just that... well... I worked for him... but in the same building and saw him everday... back when it still must have seemed like a dream... back when he still seemed happy... and we share a similar goofy
            laugh...
            <br><br>
            Though I strived for it in my youth... success never looked like anything all that fun to me...

          </p>

          <h3>Entertainment-Wise</h3>
          <p>It's not that I'm one of those people who take issue with those who opt to <strong>sellout</strong>... in fact... I've always seen selling out as the <em>American Dream</em>... I never liked witnessing creative people <em>give up</em> or <strong>lose their freedom</strong>... in exchange for more...
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>...more money <span>(already mentioned)</span>...</li>
            <li>...more power...</li>
            <li>...more sex...</li>
            <li>...more being blindly adored...</li>
          </ul>
          <p>...only to end up with more people in their lives that depend on them... making it harder to take the creative risks that made that stand out from the sea of grey in the first place...
            <br><br>
            Now I'm not talking about the celebs who have always been about the fortune and fame... and are happy... living it up... I'm talking those who make it appear like it's a prison... that's clearly effecting their art... I relate to this
            scenario much more...
            <br><br>
            Even in my grandest fantasies of success... I've still always seen myself ending up miserable... so I figured why not just focus on creating whatever the hell that I want... since I am geniunely happy when I'm working on my own
            projects...

            <br><br>

            I'm begining to think that the characters from my stories are not only <em>amalgamations</em> of people I know in real life... but they may also be my childhood <strong>imaginary friends</strong> which is why I end up going so deep into
            my worlds of imagination... making it less about creating art and more about escaping the reality that I'm locked in...

          </p>


          <h3>Business-Wise</h3>
          <p>Well... pretty much the same thing as Entertainment-Wise... business people just have a different way of being creative... the main difference is... business people are more often honest about their motives to rule the world... or at
            least the world they've created in their heads...
            <br><br>
            Of course there are many acceptions... again... I'm talking more about the ones who I used to be cheering for... the ones that seemed to have lost their genuine smiles...


          </p>

          <h3>Why take it out on structure???</h3>
          <p>I've always felt that sticking to my guns... and digging my heels in when challenged on my anti-structure stance... was partially a coping technique against failure... but I'm now starting to see the benefits of the
            <strong>self-sabataging</strong> technique...

          </p>


          <ol>
            <li>It's not that I disagree with <em>a lot</em> of the feedback I recieved... I knew that technically they were correct when it came to my story structure... I wanted to try <strong>something new</strong> the constant reminders
              reinforced what the rules are... so I've got that... </li>
            <li>Since I never <em>settled in</em> and tried to make one story perfect... I spent decades looking for different ways to escape the same box... giving me lot of options moving on... I've learned to keep my options open... while testing
              the fence in every area of my creative life...</li>
            <li>As my story telling skills fade as my mind now seems more obsessed with the visual elements over the words... so... as soon as my coding skills get up to the level that's needed to create the mixed media art that I see in my head...
              I'll already have the stories that will make up the backdrop...</li>
            <li>I can effortlessly ramble at the keys... whether or not I'm any good is up to you to decide... but I never have writer block... making it easy to create quick content... that I hope is entertaining... as I learn to code...</li>
            <li>My obsession with trying to solve this structure problem has led me on a quest that I hope will never end... and I did this while avoiding the social expectation for a life structure... </li>
          </ol>
          <p>I just wish there would have been a way for me to get to this place without so much loss... but I guess it all had to happen... I don't know how I would exist if I was still living in Seattle during this pandemic... It's weird... just
            when I started to get used to my shut-in existence... my life structure has been forced onto the rest of the world... </p>

          <h3>What now???</h3>
          <p>
            If you want my advice????

            <br><br>

            Use this time to learn... there are a lot of cheap options out there... especially if you would rather educate yourself for your own good... and not just a piece of paper to hang on the wall... that said... most of these cheap courses
            provide not only knowledge... but certificates you can print!!!
